		intro: "Bicycle-sharing programs provide bikes for rent or temporary use in urban environments. Today, there are bike-sharing programs in 165 cities around the world. Bike-sharing systems typically involve customized bike design, docking stations, and an affordable membership fee to avoid theft and promote financial sustainability. Bike sharing provides free or low-cost transportation with no emissions. The system was first employed in Amsterdam in 1969 when a fleet of bikes was painted white and distributed throughout the city. Other cities with bike-sharing programs include Berlin (with two programs, started in 2003 and 2009) Paris (2007), Barcelona (2007), and London (2010), among others. New York City will be launching one in the spring of 2013. In major cities around the world, the programs are typically sponsored by major corporations.",
		idea: "The Dynamic Connections Map rates different Berlin streets on their amenability for cycling, based on a variety of criteria, including traffic volume, topography, and safety considerations. Users are able to identify which streets should have future biking infrastructure, creating a crowdsourced map of the potential future biking network in Berlin.",

		intro: "The Maker movement is a participatory, social culture that invites and inspires all kinds of people and communities to invent, build, and hack. Making and doing with your hands encourages creativity, innovation, and ultimately, design thinking. This mentality advocates for transparency in design and production and resists built-in obsolescence. It also favors self-initiated production over consumerism. The Maker Faire, which was founded by Dale Dougherty in 2006, is an important meeting point for makers worldwide, as are the two leading maker-oriented journals, Make and Craft.",

Short presentations by each of the speakers were followed by an interactive discussion with the audience.",

		intro: "Occupy Wall Street is a global grassroots protest movement that began on September 17, 2011, with a two-month occupation of Zuccotti Park in New York?s financial district. The original occupation inspired encampments and a variety of protest activities around the globe in resistance to social and economic inequality, corporate influence on government, and a widening divide in income distribution. The movement produced the slogan, ?We are the 99 percent,? which refers to the divide between the wealthiest one percent and the rest of the population.",

		intro: "Contrary to popular belief, ostriches do not bury their heads in the ground when threatened. This myth is thought to have its roots in the accounts of Pliny the Elder, a philosopher and naturalist who lived during the first century A.D. A description Pliny wrote contributed to the false notion that ostriches cover their heads and believe that, in doing so, they hide their entire bodies. This body language and the associated metaphor has come to signify an attitude of denial, which can be used in urban settings when referring to social interaction among citizens that communicates an indifference to the adverse or harsh conditions of everyday street life.",
		idea: "Using role-play and open, direct discussion, Being Brave addressed the issue of physical and psychological violence that afflicts communities in the city. Individuals who suffer such violence often stifle their reactions with silence due to fear, inconvenience, and shame, among other concerns; similarly, witnesses of this abuse exhibit characteristics of the ostrich effect and refrain from looking at or acknowledging the abuse inflicted by others.",

		intro: "Rainwater harvesting provides an independent water supply by capturing, diverting, and storing rainwater for later use. Rainwater harvesting is beneficial, since it reduces demand on the existing water supply and reduces runoff, erosion, and contamination of surface water. A rainwater harvesting system can range in size and complexity, but is easy to understand, install, and operate; it generally has negligible operating costs. The systems have been adopted in many countries to supplement the main water supply.",
		idea: "<p>The Water Bench aims to cut back consumption of public water used to irrigate parks and green spaces in cities. It makes use of the unique condition of continuous, heavy rainfaII during the wet season, which allows the bench to fill its internal reservoir. This water is then used to irrigate surrounding vegetation during the eight-month dry spell that follows.</p><p>In addition to collecting rainwater, the Water Bench provides public seating. The first Water Benches have been installed in Mumbai's Horniman Circle and Cross Maidan for a one-year prototyping phase, starting at the beginning of monsoon season. The goal for this project's implementation in Mumbai is to install enough units per park to make them both verdant and independent from public water.</p>",

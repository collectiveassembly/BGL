Bike-sharing systems typically involve customized bike design, docking stations, and an affordable membership fee to avoid theft and promote financial sustainability. Bike sharing provides free or low-cost transportation with no emissions. The system was first employed in Amsterdam in 1969 when a fleet of bikes was painted white and distributed throughout the city. Other cities with bike-sharing programs include Berlin (with two programs, started in 2003 and 2009) Paris (2007), Barcelona (2007), and London (2010), among others. New York City will be launching one in the spring of 2013. In major cities around the world, the programs are typically sponsored by major corporations.",

This myth is thought to have its roots in the accounts of Pliny the Elder, a philosopher and naturalist who lived during the first century A.D. A description Pliny wrote contributed to the false notion that ostriches cover their heads and believe that, in doing so, they hide their entire bodies. This body language and the associated metaphor has come to signify an attitude of denial, which can be used in urban settings when referring to social interaction among citizens that communicates an indifference to the adverse or harsh conditions of everyday street life.",

		term: "Rainwater harvesting provides an independent water supply by capturing, diverting, and storing rainwater for later use. Rainwater harvesting is beneficial, since it reduces demand on the existing water supply and reduces runoff, erosion, and contamination of surface water. A rainwater harvesting system can range in size and complexity, but is easy to understand, install, and operate; it generally has negligible operating costs. The systems have been adopted in many countries to supplement the main water supply.",

This water is then used to irrigate surrounding vegetation during the eight-month dry spell that follows.</p><p>In addition to collecting rainwater, the Water Bench provides public seating. The first Water Benches have been installed in Mumbai's Horniman Circle and Cross Maidan for a one-year prototyping phase, starting at the beginning of monsoon season. The goal for this project's implementation in Mumbai is to install enough units per park to make them both verdant and independent from public water.</p>",

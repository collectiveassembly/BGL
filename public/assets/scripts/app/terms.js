Users identify which streets are inneed of infrastructure repair and suggest optimal routes,creating a crowdsourced map of the ideal biking network inBerlin. By popular demand, the map has now expanded to othercities worldwide, including Brisbane, Guadalajara, Hong Kong,Munich, and Vancouver, among others. The map was initiated byBerlin Lab Team member Rachel Smith with John Schimmel andDave Dawson.</p>",
